[[actuator.monitoring.customizing-management-server-context-path]]
== Customizing the Management Endpoint Paths

Sometimes, it is useful to customize the prefix for the management endpoints.
For example, your application might already use `/actuator` for another purpose.
You can use the configprop:management.endpoints.web.base-path[] property to change the prefix for your management endpoint, as the following example shows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      base-path: "/manage"
----

The preceding `application.properties` example changes the endpoint from `/actuator/\{id}` to `/manage/\{id}` (for example, `/manage/info`).

NOTE: Unless the management port has been configured to xref:actuator/monitoring.adoc#actuator.monitoring.customizing-management-server-port[expose endpoints by using a different HTTP port], `management.endpoints.web.base-path` is relative to `server.servlet.context-path` (for servlet web applications) or `spring.webflux.base-path` (for reactive web applications).
If `management.server.port` is configured, `management.endpoints.web.base-path` is relative to `management.server.base-path`.

If you want to map endpoints to a different path, you can use the configprop:management.endpoints.web.path-mapping[] property.

The following example remaps `/actuator/health` to `/healthcheck`:

[configprops,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      base-path: "/"
      path-mapping:
        health: "healthcheck"
----



[[actuator.monitoring.customizing-management-server-port]]
== Customizing the Management Server Port

* uses
    ** if cloud-based deployments -> ⚠️ exposing management endpoints -- via -- default HTTP port : sensible choice for ⚠️
        *** If you want to use a custom management port on Cloud Foundry -> explicitly set up the application's routes / -- forward traffic to -- the custom port
            **** Reason: 🧠On Cloud Foundry, by default, applications receive requests only on port 8080 (both HTTP and TCP) 🧠
    ** if application runs inside your own data center -> you may use different HTTP ports
* how to configure?
    ** set the `management.server.port`

    [configprops,yaml]
    ----
    management:
      server:
        port: 8081
    ----



[[actuator.monitoring.management-specific-ssl]]
== Configuring Management-specific SSL

When configured to use a custom port, you can also configure the management server with its own SSL by using the various `management.server.ssl.*` properties.
For example, doing so lets a management server be available over HTTP while the main application uses HTTPS, as the following property settings show:

[configprops,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8443
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    key-store: "classpath:store.jks"
    key-password: "secret"
management:
  server:
    port: 8080
    ssl:
      enabled: false
----

Alternatively, both the main server and the management server can use SSL but with different key stores, as follows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8443
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    key-store: "classpath:main.jks"
    key-password: "secret"
management:
  server:
    port: 8080
    ssl:
      enabled: true
      key-store: "classpath:management.jks"
      key-password: "secret"
----



[[actuator.monitoring.customizing-management-server-address]]
== Customizing the Management Server Address

You can customize the address on which the management endpoints are available by setting the configprop:management.server.address[] property.
Doing so can be useful if you want to listen only on an internal or ops-facing network or to listen only for connections from `localhost`.

NOTE: You can listen on a different address only when the port differs from the main server port.

The following example `application.properties` does not allow remote management connections:

[configprops,yaml]
----
management:
  server:
    port: 8081
    address: "127.0.0.1"
----



[[actuator.monitoring.disabling-http-endpoints]]
== Disabling HTTP Endpoints

If you do not want to expose endpoints over HTTP, you can set the management port to `-1`, as the following example shows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
management:
  server:
    port: -1
----

You can also achieve this by using the configprop:management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude[] property, as the following example shows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        exclude: "*"
----
