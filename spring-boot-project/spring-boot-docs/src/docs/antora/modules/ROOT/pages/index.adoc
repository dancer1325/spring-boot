= Spring Boot

* allows
    ** making easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications /
        *** very little Spring configuration
* how to start them?
    ** `java -jar ...` or
    ** other tradittional ones -- _Example:_ .war --
* Goals
    ** getting-started experience for ALL Spring development
    ** Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults. ‚ùì
    ** non-functional features / common to large classes of projects
        *** _Example:_ embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
    ** NO code generation (when not targeting native image) & NO requirement for XML configuration
